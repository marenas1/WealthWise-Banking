## **Tech Stack**
WealthWise Banking utilizes a modern web stack to provide users with a fast and secure finance management experience:

- **Frontend:**
  - **React** â€“ JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first CSS framework for fast styling
  - **React Router** â€“ For routing and navigation within the app
  - **Axios** â€“ For making HTTP requests to the backend

- **Backend:**
  - **Express.js** â€“ Web framework for Node.js, used to create a REST API
  - **Plaid API** â€“ Financial data provider used to link and fetch transactions from users' bank accounts

- **Hosting and Deployment:**
  - **Render** â€“ For frontend deployment, may take around 50 seconds to start up due to app inactivity
  - **Railway** â€“ For backend deployment and hosting the REST API

## **How Plaid Integration Works**

**Plaid** is used to securely connect the user's bank account to the application.

1. **Plaid Link Token Generation:**
   - On page load, a request is sent to the backend to generate a **Link Token** from Plaid using the `/create_link_token` API endpoint.
   - The token is used to open the Plaid Link UI, allowing users to securely log in to their bank accounts.

2. **Plaid Link UI:**
   - Once the token is received, the Plaid Link UI is opened, and the user selects their bank and logs in using their credentials.
   
3. **Exchange Public Token for Access Token:**
   - Upon successful login, Plaid provides a **public_token**, which is exchanged for a long-lived **access_token** using the `/exchange_public_token` API endpoint.
   
4. **Fetching Transactions and Account Balances:**
   - With the **access_token**, the backend makes requests to Plaidâ€™s API to fetch:
     - Account balances (`/get_account_balances` endpoint)
     - Transaction history within a specified date range (`/get_transactions` endpoint)

5. **Storing Data in Session:**
   - All relevant data (transactions, account balances, and access tokens) is securely stored in the user's session storage for use throughout the application.
